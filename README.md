# MTGProxyProject

<h4>MTG Proxy Project</h4>

<p>
I created this to allow me to run proxies in a clean, fun manner. It has many of the basic
MTG function built into it such as mill, counters, fields, etc.
</p>

<p>
The main page is the DeckSelector.php file. This page allows the player to choose a deck from
existing decklists as well as background art for the board, hand, and sleeves.
</p>

<p>
After selecting the deck and background arts and pressing 'Play', the player is redirected to
BoardDisp.php, which is where all cards on the battlefield appear. The player may now also access
HandDisp.php from a different device.
</p>

<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<p>
You must be able to host a webserver from one of you devices for this to work. On Linux devices,
the php package works very well.
